# __Practical Machine Learning on Google Cloud__ :warning:(WIP) :warning:

This repository briefly explains what GCP is, mentions some of its useful services for Machine Learning applications and explains why they are useful. It also __includes__:
* Practical __exercises and solutions__ for real world tasks using a GCP service.
* Complete __step by step projects__ using multiple GCP services.
* Links to other useful resources.

The goal is to help you learn how to use GCP services by gaining hands-on experience solving real-world problems.

# __Machine Learning on GCP__
## __Brief explanation of Google Cloud (GCP)__
<details>
  <summary>Click to show.</summary>

__Google Cloud Platform (GCP)__ is a provider of computing resources for developing, deploying, and operating applications on the web. It offers a wide range of services, such as computing power, storage, and networking, which can be accessed on-demand and self-service via a user interface or APIs.

__In simpler terms__, GCP allows to rent Google's computers and resources to run your own program or store data.

## __GCP Services Categories__
<details>

* __Compute__: These services provide scalable, high-performance virtual machines that run in Google's data centers.

* __Storage__: Services for storing and managing data in various formats.

* __Networking__: These services facilitate network management, load balancing, and connectivity between GCP resources.

* __Identity and Security__: This category focuses on managing access and securing GCP resources.
* __Management__: Services that help with monitoring, logging, diagnostics, and deployment of GCP resources.

* __Big Data__: Services for processing, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets.

* __Machine Learning and AI__: Services for building, training, and deploying machine learning models and AI applications.

* __Internet of Things (IoT)__: Services for connecting, processing, and managing IoT devices and data.

## __Main GCP Services used in this repository__ 

### __BigQuery__
<details>
  <summary>Click to show.</summary>

(Storage, Analytical, SQL)

__Used to store, organize and analyze large amounts of structured data using SQL.__ 

__For example__: Imagine that you are a scientist who collects data about the weather every day. You might have a lot of information about things like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, but it would be hard to look at all of it at once. That's where BigQuery comes in. It lets you put all of that data in one place and ask questions about it, like "What was the average temperature last month?" or "How many days was it windy in the last six months?".

# __Practical Exercises with Solutions__

The exercises are available in the __exercises__ folder, organized by GCP services.
