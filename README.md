# Practical Machine Learning on Google Cloud (WIP)

I created this repository to briefly explain GCP products that might be useful for practical Machine Learning applications and also to store practical resources, guides, and best practices for implementing machine learning solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The goal is to help you efficiently explore datasets, build models, and solve real-world problems using GCP services.

## Brief explanation of Google Cloud (GCP)

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a provider of computing resources for developing, deploying, and operating applications on the web. It offers a wide range of services, such as computing power, storage, and networking, which can be accessed on-demand and self-service via a user interface or APIs.

## GCP Services Categories:
